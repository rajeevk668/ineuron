    "The generate_permutations function takes in the string s, the left index, and the right index. It uses a backtracking approach to generate all possible permutations. The base case is when the left and right indices are equal, which means we have formed a permutation. In that case, we print the string. Otherwise, we iterate through the characters from the left index to the right index, swap them, and recursively call generate_permutations with the updated left index. After the recursive call, we swap the characters back to their original positions to backtrack and explore other possibilities.\n",
